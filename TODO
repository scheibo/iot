# TODO

- autotest (use watchr?)
- reformat with ${:-} and ${:=}
- further customization
- condensed format
- suffix support
- command line options
- quiet mode (speeds up, prints output on first fail)
- timing performance
- progressbar with instant failing messages
- indent the fail messages
- unified diff compare (-u or -c or something?)

- progname + test_progname
- progrname + test/test_progname (test_ prefix)
- progrname + test/{suite1,suite2}/*
- spec style:

test_contains_correct_stuff(){
  it "Must contain math"
  grep $output "math*"
}
- ie/ runs programs and instead of using diff uses the command given and compares the output to it?
- move it to bottom, run depending on $?
- ideal: just run each function and it does all the work (calls program, redirects output, status
  code is all that matters)
- provide hooks to allow it to use variables like PROGNAME and OUTPUTFILE and what not, pass all
  the stuffs to the function beginning with test_ and use exit status

- types of tests: standard suite, progress bar, quiet, sudden death, etc
